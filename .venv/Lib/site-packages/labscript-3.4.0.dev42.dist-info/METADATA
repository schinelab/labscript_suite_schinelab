The **labscript** Python library permits expressive composition of hardware-timed experiments. Hardware connections and experiment logic are described using Python classes, functions and methods, which labscript translates into low-level primitives specific to individual instruments.

<!-- Thus the experimenter writes a labscript primitive such as `laser_beam.constant(t=3, value=100, units='mW')` and this
will add an entry to the table of instructions for whichever digital-to-analogue converter is controlling the a laser beam to output 100 mW, 3 seconds after the experiment commences. This is a simple example, but has advantages over having a human write tables of instructions for scientific instruments directly. -->


## Installation

labscript is distributed as a Python package on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/user/labscript-suite) and [Anaconda Cloud](https://anaconda.org/labscript-suite), and should be installed with other components of the _labscript suite_. Please see the [installation guide](https://docs.labscriptsuite.org/en/latest/installation) for details.
